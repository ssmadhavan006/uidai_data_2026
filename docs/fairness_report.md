## Executive Summary

This report documents the fairness analysis of the Aadhaar child biometric update forecasting and recommendation system. Key findings:

1. **Infrastructure Disparity**: Significant 2.1x difference in update rates between high and low infrastructure districts
2. **Completion Gap**: 18% completion rate gap between performance tiers
3. **Intervention Allocation**: System appropriately targets low-infrastructure areas

## Methodology

### Protected Group Definitions

| Group | Proxy | Classification |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Urbanization Tier | State-level average bio updates | Above/below median |
| Performance Tier | District completion rate | Above/below median |

### Disparity Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Error Disparity | (worst_MAPE - best_MAPE) / best_MAPE | Forecast accuracy gap |
| Service Latency Gap | max(backlog) - min(backlog) | Update delay disparity |
| Update Rate Ratio | high_tier / low_tier | Resource access ratio |

---

## Results

### By Infrastructure Tier

| Tier | Mean Bio Updates | Mean Backlog | Completion Rate |
|------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| High Infrastructure | 245.3 | 156.2 | 0.87 |
| Low Infrastructure | 118.7 | 312.4 | 0.71 |

**Update Rate Ratio**: 2.07x (high disparity)

### By Performance Tier

| Tier | Mean Bio Updates | Mean Backlog | Completion Rate |
|------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| High Performer | 198.4 | 142.8 | 0.89 |
| Low Performer | 165.6 | 326.1 | 0.69 |

**Completion Gap**: 20% (moderate disparity)

## Intervention Impact Analysis

### Simulator Fairness Check

| Group | Interventions Allocated | Budget Share |
|-------|------------------------|--------------|
| Low Infrastructure | 12 | 58% |
| High Infrastructure | 8 | 42% |

**Fairness Ratio**: 1.5 (interventions favor underserved districts ✅)

### Projected Equity Improvement

With recommended interventions:
- Backlog disparity: Expected reduction of 35%
- Update rate ratio: Projected to decrease from 2.1x to 1.4x

---

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Mobile Camps** in low-infrastructure districts to address the 2.1x update disparity
2. **Staff Training Focus** on low-performer districts to improve completion rates
3. **Extended Hours Programs** in high-backlog areas to accelerate processing

---

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Effect Size Impact

| Scenario | Backlog Reduction | Cost per Update |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Conservative | 25% | ₹185 |
| Median | 35% | ₹152 |
| Optimistic | 48% | ₹118 |

The recommendation engine remains stable across scenarios, with low-infrastructure districts consistently prioritized.
